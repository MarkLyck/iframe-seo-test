# iframe-seo-test

This page is hosted on: https://marklyck.github.io/iframe-seo-test/

Before this test, currently only marklyck.com own website will show up on Google if you Google:

"No render blocking JavaScript bundles were shipped in the loading of this website."

If this test works and Google + Other search engines can index the content of iFrames correctly, and attribute that content to the website where the iFrame is hosted, the above github pages URL should show up as well once the site has been indexed by Google.
