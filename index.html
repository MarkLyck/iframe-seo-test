    <h1>iFrame SEO test</h1>
    <p>
      iFrames can be used in SEO, but there are some important considerations to
      keep in mind. While most major search engines are able to crawl and index
      content within iFrames, the way they handle it may not be ideal for SEO.
      Search engines may not give as much weight to content within iFrames, and
      the URLs for the pages within the iFrame will not be indexed.
      Additionally, using iFrames can make it more difficult for search engines
      to understand the structure and content of a webpage. It's best to use
      iFrames sparingly and to supplement them with other forms of content, such
      as text and images, to ensure that search engines can properly understand
      and index your site.
